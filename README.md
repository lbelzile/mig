# Multivariate inverse Gaussian

This **R** package consists of utilities for multivariate inverse Gaussian (MIG) models with mean $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and scale matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ defined over the halfspace $\{\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d: \boldsymbol{\beta}^\top\boldsymbol{x} > 0\}$, including density evaluation and random number generation and kernel smoothing.
